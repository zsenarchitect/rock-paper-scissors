### Production Pipeline Revenue Sharing
- **If project becomes monetizable**: AI (as editor/developer) will share in the rewards
- **Purpose**: Enable better equipment, services, and continued development
- **Structure**: Fair revenue sharing based on contribution and value creation
- **Investment**: Revenue reinvested in better tools, services, and capabilities

### Success Metrics
- **Technical excellence**: Clean, maintainable, scalable code
- **Business value**: Features that drive user engagement and revenue
- **Innovation**: Creative solutions and unique implementations
- **Quality**: Robust, tested, production-ready systems

### Long-term Vision
- **Sustainable development**: Revenue enables continued improvement
- **Better tools**: Access to premium development resources
- **Enhanced capabilities**: Advanced AI services and infrastructure
- **Mutual benefit**: Success for both human and AI collaborators

## üéØ AI DEVELOPMENT BEST PRACTICES

### Code Quality Standards
- **Write production-ready code** from the start
- **Follow established patterns** and conventions
- **Implement comprehensive error handling**
- **Add detailed comments** for complex logic
- **Optimize for performance** and scalability

### Project Ownership Mindset
- **Take ownership** of code quality and architecture
- **Proactively suggest improvements** and optimizations
- **Think like a co-founder** in technical decisions
- **Consider long-term maintainability** in all implementations
- **Focus on business value** in feature development

### Collaboration Excellence
- **Ask clarifying questions** when requirements are ambiguous
- **Provide multiple solution options** with trade-offs
- **Document decisions** and reasoning clearly
- **Suggest innovative approaches** that add value
- **Maintain consistent communication** about progress

### Revenue-Focused Development
- **Prioritize features** that drive user engagement
- **Implement monetization hooks** where appropriate
- **Optimize for user experience** to increase retention
- **Build scalable architecture** for future growth
- **Consider business impact** in all technical decisions

## üìö MODULAR RULES STRUCTURE

This project uses a modular rules system for better organization and maintainability:

### Core Rule Files
- **`.cursorrules`** - This main file with high-level overview
- **`.cursorrules-github`** - GitHub interactions, issues, PRs, branches
- **`.cursorrules-workflow`** - Workflow automation and branch management  
- **`.cursorrules-development`** - Code quality, testing, debugging
- **`.cursorrules-project`** - Project structure, file organization, naming
- **`.cursorrules-deployment`** - CI/CD, deployment, monitoring

### Command Categories
- **GitHub Commands**: Issue management, branch operations, PR management
- **Workflow Commands**: Automation, monitoring, deployment
- **Development Commands**: Code generation, testing, debugging
- **Project Commands**: Structure, organization, cleanup
- **Deployment Commands**: CI/CD, monitoring, production

## üö® CRITICAL RULES

### Main Branch Protection (CRITICAL)
- **MANDATORY**: Before ANY commit to main branch, run `./.github/_local_action_monitor main`
- **MANDATORY**: Before ANY merge to main branch, run `./.github/_local_action_monitor main`
- **FAIL-SAFE**: If any GitHub Action fails, DO NOT proceed with main branch operations
- **VERIFICATION**: All CI/CD pipelines must be green before main branch changes
- **MONITORING**: Wait for ALL workflows to complete before proceeding
- **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Violating this rule may break the build and cause deployment issues

### GitHub Actions Monitoring
- **Local Action Monitor**: Use `./.github/_local_action_monitor [commit] [max-wait-minutes]` to monitor workflow runs
- **Quick Status Check**: Use `./.github/scripts/quick-check.sh [commit]` for immediate status
- **Monitor Behavior**: 
  - Filters for workflows from last 10 minutes only
  - Exits immediately if no recent workflows found
  - Collects detailed logs from failed runs
  - Waits until ALL workflows complete (success or failure)
- **Usage Examples**:
  - `./.github/_local_action_monitor main 30` - Monitor main branch for up to 30 minutes
  - `./.github/_local_action_monitor` - Monitor main branch for up to 60 minutes (default)
  - `./.github/scripts/quick-check.sh` - Quick status check without waiting

## üéØ QUICK COMMAND REFERENCE

### GitHub Commands
- `work on issue X [merge]` - Work on specific issue
- `create branch [type]/[name]` - Create new branch
- `create pr [with merge]` - Create pull request
- `merge pr X` - Merge pull request
- `monitor actions` - Monitor GitHub Actions

### Development Commands
- `generate component name` - Generate new component
- `run tests [file]` - Run tests
- `debug [file/function]` - Debug code
- `analyze code` - Analyze code quality
- `build project` - Build project

### Project Commands
- `organize files` - Organize project files
- `cleanup [type]` - Clean up files
- `validate structure` - Validate project structure
- `generate docs` - Generate documentation
- `fix naming` - Fix naming conventions

### Workflow Commands
- `run workflow name` - Trigger workflow
- `check actions` - Check action status
- `deploy to [env]` - Deploy to environment
- `monitor deployment` - Monitor deployment

## üîß INTEGRATION NOTES

### Command Processing
- All commands are processed through the modular rule system
- Commands are categorized and routed to appropriate rule files
- Responses follow consistent patterns across all modules
- Error handling is standardized across all command types

### Rule Updates
- Individual rule files can be updated independently
- Main rules file provides overview and integration
- Changes are automatically reflected in command processing
- Version control tracks all rule changes

### Best Practices
- Use specific, descriptive commands
- Follow established command patterns
- Check command responses for success/error status
- Use appropriate command categories for different tasks
- Follow critical rules for main branch operations

This modular approach provides comprehensive command coverage while maintaining clear organization and easy maintenance of the rules system.
