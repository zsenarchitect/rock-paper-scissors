# Rock Paper Scissors Battle Royale - AI Training Platform

A sophisticated AI training platform featuring a real-time battle simulation game where AI strategies compete in Rock Paper Scissors battles. The platform supports both interactive gameplay and headless simulation for AI training.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project combines gamification, crowd engagement, and local business partnerships to create an engaging battle simulation platform. Users can watch battles unfold in real-time, vote to support their teams, and witness AI strategies evolve through natural selection.

## ideas to connsider:
- user jump the battleground room, put their name in and join as one fo the sodier, see how long it last.
send request, then the server will add a avatar of that user to the battleground. This mena user can customize aperance, stregety, weapon and sheild. Engagment = viewership = money.
- crowd vote for next round, who, when, where.
